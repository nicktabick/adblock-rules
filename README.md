# AdBlock Rules

This repository contains some custom [AdBlock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/en/about) rules I use to make life online easier (or just nicer to look at).  Most of the content blocked here deals with sites I or my contributors regularly visit.

## Disclaimer

You may find that these rules are overzealous, especially when it comes to things like in-browser chat systems.  If you find certain rules annoying, you should be able to determine the problematic rule using the comments and disable it through the AdBlock Plus settings.

My contributors and I are not responsible for any harm that may befall you from using these rules, including content mistakenly hidden by one of these rules.  If you believe that important content may be hidden accidentally, try disabling ABP completely for that page or site.

These rules are (usually) developed and used in the latest Firefox nightly build.  If you find that you have problems with a rule on another platform, please report an issue so I can look into it.

## Usage

In order to use these rules, you'll need the appropriate browser plugin.

* [Firefox](https://adblockplus.org/en/firefox)
* [Chrome](https://adblockplus.org/en/chrome)
* [Opera](https://adblockplus.org/en/opera)

Each browser's APB plugin is slightly different, but you should be able to add one of the following URLs (don't add both!) to AdBlock Plus as a custom filter subscription:

* **Two Slashes:** <http://adblock.twoslashes.com/nt-adblock.txt>
* **Latest Repository Contents:** <http://bitbucket.org/nicktabick/adblock-rules/raw/default/nt-adblock.txt>

## Contributions

I accept any and all contributions or requests for additional rules.  Please open an issue or fork the repository and submit a pull request.
